# NUMAModel
Modeling &amp; Design multi-core NUMA simulator and protocols 

# Purpose
This project was create to allow other researchers in this field to continue their research without needing the machine itself. Because NUMA is a complex machine there are many Algorithms on slicing data on RAMs and tasks on Processoures.
